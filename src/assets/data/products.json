This phone is a little bit slimmer than its predecessor when unfolded and the overall weight is a bit lower at 271g (vs 282g), but it's still just as chunky in its folded state. The outer display or â€˜cover screen' on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is more or less the same as it was on the Galaxy Z Fold 2, except that it now supports an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate. The main attraction is of course the folding 7.6-inch AMOLED display which has a higher resolution of 2,208x1,768, along with HDR10 playback and a 120Hz refresh rate",
